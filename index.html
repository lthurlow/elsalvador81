<p>On April 29th, 1981 American journalist George Thurlow was shot by members of the El Salvador Treasury Police on a jungle road in San Salvador. His 29-year-old driver, Gilberto Moran, was killed and Associated Press photgrapher Joanquin Zuniga was seriously injured in the shooting.  Thurlow left El Salvador two days later to receive medical treatment in the United States.  In 2000, he began a more than two-decade search to find Gilberto Moran's grave and some form of personal redemption.  <i>El Salvador: Blood On All Our Hands</i>  details that search and introduces us to those who fought in the civil war, U.S. aid workers helping to rebuild the tiny country, as well as every day Salvadorans who suffered through a war that killed 70,000 of their fellow citizens.</p>
